# ParticleSwarmOptimization

Particle swarm optimization with chaos dynamics.
This project is in collaboration with Clara Cassaigne, Robin Batard, Mathieu mari.

The entire code is in Python.
The purpose of this subject is to find the global minimum of a function. This function can be in 3 dimensions but also in greater dimensions.
To do so, we used a particle swarm and we optimized it -> the swarm converges toward the global minimum.

-> The main difficulty is to avoid local minima.


The great specificity of the project was to study the influence of chaos dynamics on the result.
